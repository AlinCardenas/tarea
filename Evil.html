		<center><p>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			Rosemary<br>
			Heaven restores you in life<br>
			You're coming with me<br>
			Through the aging, the fearing, the strife<br>
			It's the smiling on the package<br>
			It's the faces in the sand<br>
			It's the thought that moves you upwards<br>
			Embracing me with two hands<br>
			Right will take you places<br>
			Yeah, maybe to the beach<br>
			When your friends, they do come crying<br>
			Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Hey, wait<br>
			Great smile<br>
			Sensitive to fate, not<br>
			Denial<br>
			But hey, who's on trial?<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			It took a life span with no cell mate<br>
			The long way back<br>
			Sandy, why can't we look the other way?<br>

			[Verse 2]<br>
			He speaks about travel<br>
			Yeah, we think about the land<br>
			We smart like all peoples<br>
			Feeling real tan<br>
			I could take you places<br>
			Do you need a new man?<br>
			Wipe the pollen from the faces<br>
			Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van<br>

			[Pre-Chorus]<br>
			Hey, wait<br>
			Great smile<br>
			Sensitive to fate, not<br>
			Denial<br>
			But hey, who's on trial?<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			It took a life span with no cell mate<br>
			By the long way back<br>
			Sandy, why can't we look the other way?<br>
			You're weightless, you are exotic<br>
			You need something for which to care<br>
			Sandy, why can't we look the other way?<br>
			[Verse 3]<br>
			Leave some shards under the belly<br>
			Lay some grease inside my hand<br>
			It's a sentimental jury<br>
			And the makings of a good plan<br>
			You've come to love me lightly<br>
			Yeah, you come to hold me tight<br>
			Is this motion everlasting<br>
			Or do shudders pass in the night?<br>
			Rosemary<br>
			Oh, heaven restores you in life<br>

			[Chorus]<br>
			I spent a life span with no cell mate<br>
			The long way back<br>
			Sandy, why can't we look the other way?<br>
			You're weightless, semi-erotic<br>
			You need someone to take you there<br>
			Sandy, why can't we look the other way?<br>
			Why can't we just play the other game?<br>
			Why can't we just look the other way?<br>
			</p>
