		<center><p>
            [Verse 1]<br>
            Walking down 29th and park<br>
            I saw you in another's arm<br>
            Only a month we've been apart<br>
            You look happier<br>
            Saw you walk inside a bar<br>
            He said something to make you laugh<br>
            I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours<br>
            Yeah, you look happier, you do<br>

            [Pre-Chrous]<br>
            Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
            Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
            But ain't nobody love you like I do<br>
            Promise that I will not take it personal, baby<br>
            If you're moving on with someone new<br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            'Cause baby you look happier, you do<br>
            My friends told me one day I'll feel it too<br>
            And until then I'll smile to hide the truth<br>
            But I know I was happier with you<br>

            [Verse 2]<br>
            Sat in the corner of the room<br>
            Everything's reminding me of you<br>
            Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself<br>
            You're happier, aren't you?<br>

            [Pre-Chorus 2]<br>
            Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
            But ain't nobody need you like I do<br>
            I know that there's others that deserve you<br>
            But my darling, I am still in love with you<br>

            [Chorus 2]<br>
            But I guess you look happier, you do<br>
            My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too<br>
            I could try to smile to hide the truth<br>
            But I know I was happier with you<br>

            [Outro]<br>
            ‘Cause baby you look happier, you do<br>
            I knew one day you’d fall for someone new<br>
            But if he breaks your heart like lovers do<br>
            Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you<br>
        </p>
